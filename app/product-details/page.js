                                            About Aceclofenac+paracetamol+chlorzoxazone Aceclofenac+paracetamol+chlorzoxazone is used for pain relief and muscle relaxation. Muscle pain (myalgia) is widespread and generally refers to uncomfortable sensations in the muscles, which can be due to illness, injury or excessive exercise. It can be continuous or can also occur at intervals. <br />
                                            Aceclofenac+paracetamol+chlorzoxazone contains three medicines, namely: Aceclofenac (pain killer), Paracetamol (fever reducer/mild pain reliever) and Chlorzoxazone (muscle relaxant). These work by blocking the effect of a natural chemical messenger called cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes that make another chemical (prostaglandins) and work on the central nervous system (CNS) to relax muscles, relieving pain and stiffness caused by muscle strains and sprains. <br />
